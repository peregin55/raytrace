-- Description --

EasyUnit:
  - a unit testing framework for C++ which is extremely simple and easely 
    customizable;
  - EC++ compatible for embedded version (no STL, RTTI, multiple inheritance 
    and exceptions);
  - no boilerplate code : 0 line, none, niet, nada;
  - results output and test execution are entirely customizable;
  - default configuration are optimized for general needs;
  - based on Michael Feathers' CppUnitLite framework.
  
EasyUnit was created to ease creation and use of unit testing in C++. Most of 
the existing frameworks ask programmers to create objects and use macros to 
administer test cases in addition to write their own test cases. It is the 
author belief that boilerplate code and taking care of test administration 
discourage programmers and students to use unit testing even if it is 
representing one line of code per test case.

EasyUnit is released under LGPL. See license.txt for more information.
